This Python program includes classes and methods to analyze biological sequences (DNA, RNA and amino acid). More specifically, it has methods to,
•	return the sequence type.
•	calculate nucleotide base counts in DNA and RNA sequences. The same methods should be able to plot a graph to compare each base count and save it in a figure.
•	calculate AT content in DNA and RNA sequences.
•	calculate GC content in DNA and RNA sequences.
•	compare AT and GC contents of two given input nucleotide sequences using a suitable graph.
•	transcribe an DNA sequence.
•	generate all possible combinations of 3-mers and 4-mers given the constituent bases.
•	translate an mRNA sequence.
•	calculate the hydrophobicity of a given amino acid sequence.
•	calculate the molecular weight of a given amino acid sequence.
